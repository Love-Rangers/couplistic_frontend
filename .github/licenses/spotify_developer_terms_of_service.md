Spotify Developer Terms
Version 7.0, effective as of 27 May, 2021

Introduction
Hello and welcome to the Spotify Developer Terms (the “Developer Terms”)!

We made some changes to these terms and, in the spirit of transparency, we want to be clear about what changed, so here’s a high level summary of some of the key changes:

We’ve clarified and expanded Section V Users & Data concerning the use and processing of Spotify Personal Data.
We’ve incorporated a Data Protection Appendix into these Developer Terms.
We’ve created a Developer Policy which outlines some of the key restrictions when using and developing with the Spotify Platform.
Spotify now has usage quotas which mean you may need to submit your application for review by Spotify if you hit certain thresholds. We’ve updated the terms to reflect the new quotas.
Please read these terms carefully before using our developer platform.

Principles
When reviewing our Developer Terms, please keep in mind these two principles:

Our users are very important to us. Let’s work together to give them tools to access, discover, manage, and share content. While doing so, please respect their data and privacy settings.
We love audio and have the deepest respect for the people who create it. We work hard to make sure that all of the content on Spotify is fully licensed so that we can compensate the people who have made it. And we have an obligation and a responsibility to make sure that this is reflected in what we support (or don’t) on our platform.
Section I Acceptance of Terms
Components of the Agreement. The Developer Agreement (the “Developer Agreement”) is comprised of the following:
these Developer Terms, including the Data Protection Appendix and the Developer Policy;
our Terms and Conditions of Use;
our Branding Guidelines; and
the Documentation.
Precedence. If there is an irreconcilable conflict between these Developer Terms and any other document(s) comprising the Developer Agreement, these Developer Terms shall govern. Please note that if you use any of the Spotify Widget (defined below), you will be bound by the separate Spotify Widget Terms.
Acceptance of Developer Agreement. We invite you to review, download and use our Spotify Platform. Please note that this invitation is subject to your review of and agreement with the Developer Agreement. You are not required to agree to the Developer Agreement. However, if you reject the Developer Agreement, you do not have any right to use the Spotify Platform. If you use or otherwise access the Spotify Platform, you will be deemed to have accepted the Developer Agreement and entered into a legally binding contract with Spotify AB (“Spotify”, “we”, and sometimes “us”). You may not use the Spotify Platform for any purpose that is not expressly authorized in the Developer Agreement.
Acceptance on Behalf of an Organization. If you are developing on behalf of an organization, you agree to the terms of the Developer Agreement for that organization and promise that you have authority to bind that organization and its parents, subsidiaries, and sister companies to the Developer Agreement. In that case, “you” and “your” will refer to that organization, its parents, subsidiaries, and sister companies.
Language. In the event that the Developer Agreement, or any part thereof, is translated into other languages and there is a discrepancy between versions in different languages, the English language version shall prevail to the extent that such discrepancy is the result of an error in translation.
Independent Contractors. There is no joint venture, partnership, agency, or fiduciary relationship existing between you and Spotify, and the parties do not intend to create any such relationship by the Developer Agreement.
Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein have the meaning given in our other terms and policies, including our Terms and Conditions of Use. The term “including” means “including without limitation.”
If you are an Australian consumer or small business (as defined by Australian Consumer Law): These terms do not exclude or limit any statutory rights or remedies you may have under Australian Consumer Law. However, to the extent permitted by the Australian Consumer Law, Spotify’s liability for any breach of the consumer guarantees is limited to (as elected by Spotify) the resupply of the goods or services to which the breach relates or the payment of the cost of replacing the goods or resupplying the services.

You agree not to circumvent any privacy features (e.g., opt outs) offered by Spotify, you, or by third parties.
You will only request the data you need to operate your SDA.
When users connect with your SDA, they may consent to the sharing of certain categories of Spotify Personal Data with you, with those categories selected by you in advance. For all other Spotify Personal Data obtained through use of the Spotify Platform, you must obtain explicit consent from the user who provided the data to us before using it for any purpose other than displaying it back to the user on your SDA.
You will not sell any Spotify Content or other data obtained from Spotify.
You will not email Spotify users unless you obtain their explicit consent or obtain their email address and permission through means other than Spotify.
You may only process Spotify Personal Data for as long as is necessary to provide your SDA to the applicable user, and consistent with the specific consent they’ve granted to you.
You must provide all users with a working and easily accessible mechanism to disconnect their Spotify Service account from your SDA at any time and provide clear instructions on how to do so. Further, when a user disconnects their Spotify Service account or otherwise expresses an intent to prevent your SDA from accessing their data, you agree to delete and no longer request or process any of that user’s Spotify Personal Data.
If Spotify informs you of a Spotify user having required rectification, erasure or restriction of processing of Spotify Personal Data to you, you must comply with such requests.
Prior to using the Spotify Platform, you must have in place industry standard security and protections for any Spotify Content (including Spotify Personal Data) in your possession and/or control. You are also responsible for the security measures used by third parties providing services to you.
You must display and require end users to agree to an enforceable end user agreement reflecting at least the following minimum terms:

that your collection and use of data is subject to your privacy policy;
of the information you collect from users;
about how you collect, use, and share that information;
about how users can contact you with inquiries regarding their information;
about your use of Cookies;
whether you allow third parties to place Cookies on users’ browsers in order to collect information about their browsing activities; and
about users’ options for Cookie management.
Any access, use, processing, and disclosure of Spotify Personal Data shall comply with (i) these Developer Terms; (ii) your end user agreement and privacy policy; (iii) the permissions and consents obtained from users, if applicable; (iv) the requirements of any data transfer solution implemented in accordance with paragraph 3 in the Data Protection Appendix; and (v) applicable laws and regulations.
If your application contains content submitted or provided by third parties, you must comply with the following rules:
In the United States, you must take all steps required to fall within the applicable safe harbors of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act including designating an agent to receive notices of claimed infringement, instituting a repeat infringer termination policy and implementing a “notice and takedown” process.
In other countries, you must comply with local copyright laws and implement an appropriate “notice and takedown” process upon receiving a notice of claimed infringement.
Section VI Access, Usage and Quotas
Security Codes
As described on our Developer Website, to access and use certain tools provided by the Spotify Platform, you must link your Spotify Service account to a developer account. You will be issued one or more unique I.D.s, client I.Ds, keys, passwords, security codes, or tokens (each a “Security Code”) for accessing the Spotify Platform and managing your account. You agree to provide Spotify with accurate, complete and updated registration and contact information.
You may only access your account with the Security Codes provided by Spotify and the appropriate Security Code must be embedded in your SDA, including in all updates and revisions, in a secure manner not accessible by third parties. You must use a separate Security Code for each SDA. You may not use more than one Security Code for each SDA. If you are developing a Streaming SDA, each call to the Spotify Platform must incorporate a valid Security Code.
You may not sell, transfer, sublicense or otherwise disclose your account or Security Codes to any other party or use it for any other purpose except in connection with your SDA.
You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and Security Codes. You agree to notify Spotify immediately if you believe that your account or Security Codes have been compromised and cooperate with Spotify in the investigation of any compromised Security Codes. You are fully responsible for all activities that occur using your account and Security Codes, regardless of whether such activities are undertaken by you or a third party.
Limitations on Use of Spotify Platform. Spotify may limit the number of service calls that your SDA may make, the volume of Spotify Content that may be accessed, or anything else about the Spotify Service as Spotify deems appropriate, in its sole discretion, without notice. Spotify may use technical measures to prevent over-usage or stop usage of the Spotify Platform.
App Reviews. We may review your SDA for compliance from time to time, in our sole discretion. You will cooperate with our reviews and provide any information we request thereof.
Monitoring Usage. You agree that Spotify may monitor your use of, and collect usage data related to, the Spotify Platform to ensure quality, improve the Spotify Service and verify your compliance with the Developer Agreement. You agree not to block or interfere with such efforts and to provide us with reasonable access to information related to your compliance with the Developer Agreement. Spotify may use any technical means to overcome any interference. At our sole discretion we may request, and you will provide, proof that your SDA and any content within your SDA is properly licensed.
Cooperation. You agree to cooperate with Spotify in pursuing any violations of the prohibition against ripping or other capture of streamed content.
Reporting of Non-Complying SDAs. If you believe that someone is violating these Developer Terms or otherwise misusing the Spotify Platform, Spotify Service or Spotify Content, please contact us using this form.
Modification of Spotify Platform. Spotify reserves the right to modify the Spotify Platform and to release subsequent versions of the Spotify Platform at any time without notice to you. You may be required to obtain and use the most recent version of the Spotify Platform in order for your SDA to function.
Usage and Quotas.
Spotify may use quotas and place use restrictions to ensure that the Spotify Platform is accessed and used as intended and in accordance with the Developer Agreement.
If your SDA reaches a quota limit, you can apply for a quota extension using the forms provided to you. In that case, your quota extension application must specify the use case for which you need the extension. Spotify makes no promise or guarantee that your quota extension request will be approved.
If Spotify grants an additional quota, you must use the additional quota granted only for the use case that Spotify reviewed. If any of the information you provided to Spotify when requesting the quota changes, you must notify Spotify of the change by submitting the new information to Spotify prior to using the quota extension for a non-reviewed use case.
Section VII Intellectual Property & Confidential Information
Intellectual property.
Spotify respects intellectual property rights, and expects you to do the same. The Spotify Platform, Spotify Service, Spotify Content and any Spotify Marks (our “Intellectual Property”) are the property of Spotify or Spotify’s licensors and protected by intellectual property rights. You do not have the right to use the Intellectual Property in any manner not covered by the Developer Agreement.
Nothing in the Developer Agreement shall be construed to convey, and by virtue of the Developer Agreement you will not acquire, any ownership interest in the Intellectual Property.
You will not contest, or assist others in contesting, the validity, enforceability, ownership, or title of any Intellectual Property. You agree not to attempt to use or register any trademark or domain name that includes the word “Spotify,” any other Spotify trademark, or any name that is confusingly similar to any of them.
Further, you may not remove or alter any copyright, copyright protection technology, trademark, or other intellectual property notice contained in or provided through Spotify’s Intellectual Property.
Confidentiality. In your interactions with Spotify, you may be given access to certain non-public information, software, specifications, or code (“Confidential Information”), which is confidential and proprietary to Spotify. You may use this Confidential Information only as necessary in exercising such rights as are granted to you in these Developer Terms. You may not disclose any of this Confidential Information to any third party without Spotify’s prior written consent. You further agree that you will protect this Confidential Information from any unauthorized use, access, or disclosure with no less than a reasonable degree of care than your own confidential information.

Nothing in these Developer Terms shall in any way restrict or preclude Spotify and/or such third parties from creating and fully exploiting such products, services or other business activities without any obligation to you.
If you provide Spotify with any feedback (including suggestions, comments, improvements, ideas, etc.), you assign all right, title and interest in and to such feedback to Spotify and acknowledge that we will be entitled to use, implement and exploit any such feedback in any manner without restriction, and without any obligation of confidentiality, attribution, accounting or compensation.

Term, Suspension, Termination and Survival.
These Developer Terms begin on either (i) the date you demonstrate your acceptance of the Developer Terms or (ii) when you first use the Spotify Platform, and shall continue until terminated (the “Term”) as permitted under these Developer Terms.
Compliance with the provisions of these Developer Terms is very important. Any licenses contained in these Developer Terms will terminate automatically and without notice if you fail to comply with them.
We may take enforcement action against you and your SDA, for example, if we believe in our sole discretion that: (a) you have not responded in a timely manner to our requests related to reviews, monitoring and audit; (b) you or your app has violated the Developer Agreement or any other applicable terms and policies or is negatively impacting the Spotify Platform, Spotify Content or associated creators or rightsholders; (c) in order to comply with applicable legal or regulatory requirements or to protect Spotify and its group companies from legal, reputational or regulatory liability.
We may take enforcement action at any time, including while we investigate your SDA. We may or may not notify you in advance. Enforcement can include revoking your Security Codes, disabling your SDA, restricting your, and your SDA’s, access to the Spotify Platform (including its functionality), requiring you to delete data, terminating the Developer Terms or Developer Agreement with you, or any other action that we deem appropriate.
We may suspend or end your access to the Spotify Platform or individual permissions that your SDA has not used or accessed within a 90-day period with or without notice to you.
Spotify may terminate these Developer Terms by notice to you of termination or by terminating your ability to use the Spotify Platform. You may terminate these Developer Terms by ceasing all use of the Spotify Platform and notifying Spotify.
Upon any termination or notice of any discontinuance, you must immediately cease and desist from using the Spotify Platform and delete all Spotify Content (including Spotify Personal Data) obtained through use of the Spotify Platform (including from your servers).
Spotify has no obligation to maintain, support, upgrade, or update the Spotify Platform or Spotify Service, or to provide all or any specific content. We use reasonable efforts to keep the Spotify Service and Spotify Platform operational, however, certain issues, such as technical maintenance, may from time to time result in temporary interruptions and Spotify and/or the owners of Spotify Content may remove any Spotify Content, all without notice. Except where prohibited by law, Spotify has no liability for any interruption, modification, or discontinuation of the Spotify Service, Spotify Platform, Spotify Content any function or feature thereof.
Sections III.2, III.4, III.5, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII.3, VIII.5, VIII.6, IX.8, IX.10, and X of these Developer Terms (or any section necessary to interpret such sections) shall survive any termination or expiration of these Developer Terms and will continue to bind you.
Severability. Should for any reason, or to any extent, any provision of these Developer Terms be held invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or enforceability shall not affect or render invalid or unenforceable the remaining provisions of these Developer Terms and the application of that provision shall be enforced to the extent permitted by law.

These Developer Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California without regard to conflicts of law principles, except to the extent California law is preempted by United States Federal Law, including the Federal Arbitration Act.

No Waiver. The failure or delay by Spotify to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Developer Terms or rights under applicable law shall not constitute a waiver of any such provisions or rights.
Section X Arbitration Agreement
This Section X (the “Arbitration Agreement”) which requires mandatory arbitration, applies to you if your performance under these Developer Terms will occur in whole or in part in the United States. It also applies if any part of your performance under these Developer Terms will occur in any other jurisdiction in which this Section X is enforceable:

Dispute Resolution and Arbitration. You and Spotify agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Spotify arising in connection with or relating in any way to these Developer Terms or to your relationship with Spotify (whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and whether the claims arise during or after the termination of these Developer Terms) will be determined by mandatory binding individual (not class) arbitration. You and Spotify further agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive power to rule on his or her own jurisdiction pursuant to these Developer Terms, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope or validity of the arbitration agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED. There may be more limited discovery than in court. The arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney fees), except that the arbitrator may not award any relief, including declaratory or injunctive relief, benefiting anyone but the parties to the arbitration. This arbitration provision will survive termination of these Developer Terms.
Exceptions. Notwithstanding Section X.1 above, you and Spotify both agree that nothing in this Arbitration Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our rights, at any time, to (1) bring an individual action in a U.S. small claims court; (2) pursue enforcement actions through applicable U.S. federal, state, or local agencies where such actions are available; (3) bring an individual action seeking only temporary or preliminary injunctive relief in a court of law, pending a final ruling from an arbitrator.
No Class or Representative Proceedings: Class Action Waiver. YOU AND SPOTIFY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. Unless both you and Spotify agree, no arbitrator or judge may consolidate more than one person’s claims or otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.
Arbitration Rules: U.S. Performance. This Section governs arbitration proceedings if your performance under these Developer Terms will occur entirely inside the United States. Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings. Any arbitration between you and Spotify will take place under the rules and procedures of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) then in force (the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. You and Spotify agree that the Federal Arbitration Act applies and governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision (despite the choice of law provision above). The AAA Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the AAA, appear at www.adr.org, or you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. Any arbitration hearings will take place in New York, New York, or at a location mutually agreed upon by the parties, provided that if the claim is for $25,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (1) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (2) through a telephonic hearing, which neither the parties nor witnesses need to attend in person; or (3) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the U.S. county (or parish) in which you have your principal place of business. If you choose to file an arbitration proceeding and your claim is for $10,000 or less, Spotify will (a) reimburse you for any AAA filing fee and (b) pay any other arbitration fees, including your share of arbitrator compensation, unless otherwise required by AAA rules or court order. If your claim is between $10,000 and $25,000, you will be responsible for the filing fee but Spotify will pay any other arbitration fees. If your claim exceeds $25,000, you will be responsible for the filing fee and for your share of any other fees, consistent with the AAA rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.
Arbitration Rules: Non-U.S. Performance. This Section governs arbitration proceedings if your performance under these Developer Terms will occur entirely outside the United States. Either you or we may start arbitration proceedings. Any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or in connection with these Developer Terms shall be finally settled by arbitration in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce (“SCC Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement, and administered by the Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce (“SCC”). The SCC Rules, as well as instructions on how to file an arbitration proceeding with the SCC, appear at https://sccinstitute.com/, or you may call the SCC at +46 8 555 100 00. Spotify can also help put you in touch with the SCC. The arbitral tribunal shall be composed of a sole arbitrator to be appointed by the SCC. The seat of the arbitration shall be Stockholm, Sweden, and the arbitration shall be held, and the award shall be rendered, in the English language. Any arbitration hearings will take place in Stockholm, Sweden, or at a location mutually agreed upon by the parties, provided that if the claim is for $25,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (1) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, or (2) through a telephonic hearing, which neither the parties nor witnesses need to attend in person. The award shall be final and binding on the parties and may be entered and enforced in any court having jurisdiction.
Notice; Process. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail or Federal Express, UPS, or Express Mail (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail (“Notice”). Spotify’s address for Notice is: Spotify AB, Attn: Legal Department, 150 Greenwich St 62nd floor, New York, NY 10007, United States. The Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (2) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). We agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Spotify may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Spotify shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. All documents and information disclosed in the course of the arbitration shall be kept strictly confidential by the recipient and shall not be used by the recipient for any purpose other than for purposes of the arbitration or the enforcement of arbitrator’s decision and award and shall not be disclosed except in confidence to persons who have a need to know for such purposes or as required by applicable law.
Enforceability. If any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is found to be unenforceable in court or in arbitration, then the entirety of the Arbitration Agreement shall be null and void and, in such case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section IX.10. shall govern any action arising out of or related to these Developer Terms.
